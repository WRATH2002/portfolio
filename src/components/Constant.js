export const aboutData = `Hello, I'm Himadri Purkait, a B.Tech undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. My passion lies in web development, where I’ve dedicated myself to create dynamic, user-centric websites and applications. Through numerous projects, I’ve honed my skills, always aiming to develop products that are not only functional but also visually appealing.

I believe in the power of design to solve real-world problems and enhance people's lives. My goal is to become a professional full-stack web developer, contributing to innovative projects and making a meaningful impact through technology.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy drawing, watching movies, and occasionally diving into Blender for creative exploration. I’m eager to join a team where I can learn from mentors, collaborate with professionals, and continue to upskill in a dynamic, growth-oriented environment.`;
